# Project-War #

## Project presentation ##
The goal of "Project-War" is to create a simple wargame. I like the motto "simple rules complex strategies".
It was first started in Java to target Desktop as well as Android devices. But After several fight with swing layout policies, it decided to stop and move to QML/C++.

The project is far from its competition, but to give an idea where the game is headed: it is basically between De Bellis Antiquitatis and Pocket Battle.

My PhD is keeping me away from the development, so i will resume at the end of my PhD.
